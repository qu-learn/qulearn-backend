  Summary

  I've successfully generated a comprehensive, executable integration test suite for your qulearn-backend repository. Here's what was created:

  📁 Files Generated

  1. Test Configuration

  - jest.config.mjs - Jest configuration with ts-jest for ES Modules support
  - tests/setup/globalSetup.mts - Starts MongoDB Memory Server before all tests
  - tests/setup/globalTeardown.mts - Stops MongoDB Memory Server after all tests
  - tests/setup/testSetup.mts - Clears database between each test for isolation

  2. Test Helpers

  - tests/helpers/authHelpers.mts - Authentication utilities:
    - createStudent(), createEducator(), createCourseAdmin(), createSysAdmin()
    - generateToken(userId) - Generates real JWT tokens
    - createStudentWithToken(), createEducatorWithToken() - Convenience functions

  3. Integration Tests

  - tests/integration/coursesRouter.test.mts - Comprehensive test suite covering:

    - ✅ Works for draft courses (no auth restriction)

  POST /api/v1/courses (5 tests)
    - ✅ Creates course with educator authentication
    - ✅ Creates course from Jupyter notebook URL
    - ✅ 400 when Jupyter conversion fails
    - ✅ 401 when no token provided
    - ✅ 403 when student tries to create course

  PATCH /api/v1/courses/:courseId (5 tests)
    - ✅ Updates course when educator is the instructor
    - ✅ 404 when educator tries to update course they don't own
    - ✅ 404 when course doesn't exist
    - ✅ 401 when no token provided

  POST /api/v1/courses/:courseId/lessons/:lessonId/quiz/submit (10 tests)
    - ✅ Calculates 100% score correctly
    - ✅ Calculates partial credit correctly
    - ✅ Marks lesson complete when quiz passed (≥60%)
    - ✅ Does NOT mark lesson complete when quiz failed (<60%)
    - ✅ Increments user's quiz counter
    - ✅ Awards points proportional to score
    - ✅ 404 when course doesn't exist

  🎯 Key Features

  ✅ Zero External Dependencies: All tests run against in-memory MongoDB✅ Real Authentication: Uses actual JWT tokens and Passport middleware (not mocked)✅ Database Isolation: Fresh database for      
  each test✅ External Mocks: runConversionEngine mocked to avoid fetch calls✅ Comprehensive Coverage: Happy paths, error cases, and middleware validation✅ ES Modules Support: Works with .mts
  files and modern TypeScript✅ Simply Executable: Just run npm install && npm test
